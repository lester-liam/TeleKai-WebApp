# TeleKai WebApp for KaiOS

## About
This GitHub repository contains the solution to our solution demo prototype for Team Kai GDG George Town DevHack 2023.

## Problem Statement

Telehealth has improved accessibility to healthcare ever since the COVID-19 pandemic. While cost of smartphones have fallen, they remain unaffordable towards the low-middle income countries, the lack of access to basic smartphones results in lack of healthcare access for people without physical healthcare facilities nearby. A study by World Health Organization (WOH) shows a maternal death occurs every 2 minutes, with almost 95% occured in those group of people. 

## Proposed Solution

TeleKai is a Telehealth Web-App for KaiOS, providing affordable basic health services to low-middle income users. It connects the low-middle income users with healthcare professionals by using web capable smart feature phones running KaiOS. With devices starting at USD 10, TeleKai is a low cost entry towards affordable telehealth services by bridging the communication gap between patients and healthcare providers, by using existing communications means for consult.
